Before I get started, please be aware that this post will discuss events in the latter portion of the game and will *focus on the endgame*. That means there will be **spoilers**. Consider yourself warned.

Grand Theft Auto V is a great game. In fact it's one of the best I've ever played and I will be writing a review shortly. However, it does have what I believe to be a major flaw that (for me) ruins the final act of an otherwise incredible game.

Before I explain my problem with the game, I think I need to explain what the game does well and why this mechanic hurts the ending so much. While this game is ultimately a linear story, there is a geat decision structure implemented around the multiple heists that occur. The first step of each heist is to determine the method through which the heist will occur. There are two options which generally fall into a 'smart' option and a 'loud' option. Right of the bat these choices are great: you can stay in character and choose the option that would align more closely with what your current character would choose or you can go the other route if that option is more enticing to you.

Once you've made your choice you will then have to choose your crew and will face a trade off between finding adequately skilled individuals while not surrendering to much money with their expected cuts of the score. This is further complicated by the fact that any crew members who survive the heist will improve their skills but their share of the profits will not increase. Will you try to grow your team by choosing the unskilled options (and save money in the process) or will you relinquish more of the score in the hopes that your heist will operate more smoothly with a highly-skilled team. 

**Now what is this flaw?** At the end of game the player (as Franklin) is given 3 choices: kill Trevor, kill Michael or the mysteriously named Deathwish. I won't go too far into why these choices are presented to the playe as even with the spoiler warning above I don't want to inadvertently ruin the game for anyone but it boils down to Franklin being caught in the crossfire as different parties we've dealt with throughout the game make their final moves. 

**I thought the decision structure was good in this game so why is this choice a flaw?** This choice is a flaw because (**SPOILERS**) once you know the outcome of all three choices there really wasn't a choice at all. You would expect that if two of the options ended in the deaths of Trevor and Michael then the third option 'Deathwish' would logically result in Franklin dying in lieu of his friends. If you were like me and assumed that all options would result in the death of one of the characters you had just spent so many hours with and that this meant the decision held some serious weight I'm sorry: you're wrong.

As it turns out there was basically only one right choice: Deathwish. While both 'Kill Trevor' and 'Kill Michael' resulted in a pretty anticlimactic killing off of one of the characters (and losing them in post game tomfoolery), 'Deathwish' ended with you getting the trio back together for a final battle against basically all of the foes left in the game. The level of detail in this scenario as well as the fact that all three emerged alive makes it pretty clear that this was the scenario Rockstar wanted you to pick.

For me it was only a choice between Trevor and Michael as Franklin was my favourite character in the game and I didn't want to risk losing him by going the 'Deathwish' route. Michael's life is finally meaningful again and his family is starting to work through their problems and while Trevor is simply a psycho who kills people with very little thought. Given the relative value to society of each character based on their endgame states it wasn't a hard choice for me. Pleased with my rational approach to what I believed was the greatest decision in the game I chose to kill Trevor and played out the ending. It was more emotional than I expected (he was crazy but I still liked him) but I was satisfied that it was the right choice in the long term.

At least, I thought it was the right choice until I looked into the other options and discovered my mistake: I should have picked Deathwish! Now, feeling completely cheated I went back hoping I could reload a save from before the endgame in order to fix what I had done. However, being the silly guy I am, I had relied far too heavily on the autosave feature throughout the game and my only save was at around 20% completion which was a long time ago. Resigning myself to my fate, I turned off my PS4 and pushed the game from my mind until my friend was faced with the same decision last week...

Like me, he had assumed that 'Deathwish' meant Franklin would die because why bother giving you three options if two of them were clearly inferior? He chose to kill Michael because he liked Trevor's psychotic nature and then proceeded to watch the rest of the endings to see what the other choices would have brought. Suffering the same cheated feeling as I, he called me and voiced all of the thoughts that had gone through my head when it had been me sitting on YouTube wishing I had made a different choice.

Armed with the knowledge that it wasn't just me who was bothered by this ending, I took to the internet to see what others were saying about it. As it turns out, it seems like the majority of people who didn't pick 'Deathwish' weren't happy with how the rest of the game played out. So now I'm here writing my opinion about how GTA V was ruined by a poorly thought out endgame choice.

Thanks for reading.
